# Exercise 3: Secure Infrastructure with Azure Firewall Premium

### Estimated Duration: 120 minutes

## Overview: 

Azure Firewall is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides the best-of-breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It's a fully stateful, firewall-as-a-service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic inspection.

Azure Firewall Premium is a next-generation firewall with capabilities that are required for highly sensitive and regulated environments. It includes the following features:

- **TLS Inspection:** decrypts outbound traffic, processes the data, then encrypts the data and sends it to the destination.
- **IDPS:** A network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) allows you to monitor network activities for malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it, and optionally attempt to block it.
- **URL filtering:** extends Azure Firewall’s FQDN filtering capability to consider an entire URL. For example, `www.contoso.com/a/c` instead of `www.contoso.com`.
- **Web categories:** Administrators can allow or deny user access to website categories such as gambling websites, social media websites, and others.
For more information, see `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/premium-features`
 
## Lab Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Add firewall diagnostics settings
- Task 2: Test IDPS for HTTP traffic
- Task 3: Web categories testing
- Task 4: Implement and Test URL filtering
- Task 5: IP Groups
- Task 6: Azure Firewall Policies with Firewall Manager
